		<h1 style="font-size: 70px">180sx</h1>
		<p style="font-size: 30px">The Nissan 180SX is a fastback automobile that was produced by Nissan Motors between 1988 and 1998. It is based on the S13 chassis from the Nissan S platform with the variants receiving an R designation (ex. PS13 and RPS13), and was sold exclusively in Japan paired with the CA18 motor in the early models; later models paired with the SR20 motor. Outside of Japan, it was re-badged as the 200SX and in the US market as the Nissan 240SX, paired with the single overhead cam KA24E motor and later with the dual-overhead model KA24DE.</p>

		<h2 style="font-size: 40px">History</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 25px">The 180SX was built and sold by <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan">Nissan</a></span> as a sister model to the <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Silvia">Nissan Silvia</a></span> from model year 1989 through 1998, but sold at two different Japanese Nissan dealerships. The Silvia was sold at Nissan Prince Store, and the 180SX was sold at Nissan Bluebird Store locations.

		<p style="font-size: 25px">The S13 Silvia was discontinued in 1993, but the 180SX was successful enough to convince Nissan to keep it in the market for the full length of the next generation Silvia (S14). The 180SX differed from the S13 Silvia in that it featured pop-up headlights and a liftgate with different body work at the rear of the vehicle. Specifications and equipment were similar; however, the naturally aspirated CA18DE engine was not offered. The name 180SX was originally in reference to the 1.8 liter displacement CA18DET engine used in the chassis. In 1991, however, the engine was upgraded to a 2.0 liter model, offered in two forms: the turbocharged SR20DET variant and the naturally aspirated SR20DE engine, which was introduced in 1996. Although the new engine was of larger displacement, the 180SX nomenclature remained.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 25px">180SX was also a trim level of the S110 Silvia in Europe. The badges for this model read "Silvia 180SX", so this car is not properly a 180SX by model, but a version of the Silvia instead.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 25px">Other discrepancies from this standard were distributed to Micronesia and South Pacific islands, including LHD cars with 180SX badges and non-retractable headlamps.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 25px">Like the Japanese 180SX SR20DET discrepancy, European, as well as South African models of the S13 chassis were called 200SX though equipped with the CA18DET engine.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 25px">In North America, It was sold as the Nissan 240SX Fastback with the KA24DE engine and various other trim differences.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 25px">In Europe the car was sold as a 200SX and only featured the CA18DET engine producing 169 PS (124 kW; 167 hp) through the rear wheels, taking it to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 7.5 seconds and onto 220 km/h. The car had a facelift in 1991 with new smoother bumpers, limited slip differential, and larger brakes. This 200sx was sold between 1989 and 1994 until the change to the 200SX S14 version.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 25px">Certain year model 180SX and Silvias are now available for import into the US market with EPA and DOT exemptions under the 25 year classic import law. The United States has a handful of JDM Import companies.</p>

		  <h2>Breakdown of engine codes:</h2>

		  <li style="font-size: 20px">SR/CA - Engine code name</li>
		  <li style="font-size: 20px">20/18 - Liter Displacement</li>
		  <li style="font-size: 20px">D - Dual overhead Camshaft</li>
		  <li style="font-size: 20px">E - Electronic fuel injection</li>
		  <li style="font-size: 20px">T - Turbocharged</li>

			<li style="font-size: 30px;">SR20DET</li>
			     <p style="font-size: 25px">The sr20det is a popular inline four-cylinder engine fitted into a variety of cars, generally the Nissan Silvia and 180SX. It also came in the Pulsar GTI-R, Nissan NX Coupe and the Nissan Bluebird. This engine replaced the CA18DE and CA18DET that originally powered the Silvia and 180SX. The CA18 was deemed too expensive to produce and no longer met Japanese emission standards, so it was replaced by the SR20. The SR, just like the out-going CA, was a turbocharged intercooled engine in top form. Nissan also produced a cheaper naturally aspirated version called the SR20DE.</p>

			<li style="font-size: 30px;">SR20DE</li>
			     <p style="font-size: 25px"> The SR20DE was a cheaper Naturally aspirated eninge for the 180sx and the Silvias.</p>

			<li style="font-size: 30px;">CA18DET</li>
			     <p style="font-size: 25px">The 1.8 L CA18DET was the last version of the CA engine to be released. There were 2 versions of the CA18DET available, yet only one was produced for Japan. This engine is known for stronger torque characteristics, as well as faster spool at lower RPMs. However, due to displacement-based taxation and cost of emissions testing in Europe, the CA18DET was sold as the only available engine in the S13 chassis 200SX (Euro model) until replaced by the S14 in 1994.</p>
